# Git - Files status
In your working directory, files and all contents of the repository.

Files can have several status:
###### untracked
this status is given to new files create but git didn't track them before, if any modification (addition, deletion) is done to this files git will not notice it will just keep the same status *untracked* and won't tell what changes made, and if the file is deleted or renamed git will not be able to help restore it
