# What is git?
**GIT**: Is a distributed version control system, that observes files and their statues and changes occurred on them, keeps a history of you changes so you can develop or change without worry of messing anything up, this will help you do mistakes while you are comfortable that all of your code is saved and you can get back to it before doing the mistakes.

Git saves your data as repositories, each repository has a `.git` directory that saves all your files and changes with each commit content, date, message, author being saved

There are 2 main types of repositories (repos for short) [[local repositories]], and [[remote repositories]],
